/**\class JobReport JobReport.h FWCore/MessageLogger/interface/JobReport.h

Description: A service that collections job handling information.

Usage:
The JobReport service collects 'job handling' information (currently
file handling) from several sources, collates the information, and
at appropriate intervales, reports the information to the job report,
through the MessageLogger.
